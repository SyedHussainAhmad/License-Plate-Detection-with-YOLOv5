# License Plate Detector and Reader using YOLOv5 + EasyOCR

This project detects and reads vehicle license plates from images and videos using a combination of **YOLOv5** (for object detection) and **EasyOCR** (for Optical Character Recognition). It can be used for surveillance, traffic monitoring, smart parking, or toll systems.

---

## Features

- Fast and accurate license plate detection using YOLOv5
- Text extraction from plates using EasyOCR
- Works on both images and videos
- Trained on a real-world annotated dataset from Roboflow Universe
- Saves processed outputs with bounding boxes and recognized text

## How It Works

### 1. License Plate Detection (YOLOv5)

The project uses **YOLOv5**, a real-time object detection model, trained specifically to detect license plates in images and video frames.

- **Dataset**: [License Plate Recognition ‚Äì Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/yolov5-sg5le/license_plate_recognition-qslmk/dataset/6)
- **Model**: YOLOv5 custom-trained model (`best.pt`)
- **Output**: Bounding boxes with confidence scores for detected plates

### 2. Text Recognition (EasyOCR)

After detecting and cropping the license plate regions, the system uses **EasyOCR** to read the characters on the plate.

- Works well with alphanumeric characters
- Handles various plate fonts and lighting conditions
- Outputs the extracted text overlaid on the image or video frame
